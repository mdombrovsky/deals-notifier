# Deals Notifier
This is meant to aggregate Canadian deals posted to [RedFlagDeals](https://forums.redflagdeals.com/) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bapcsalescanada), and notify you when desired deals occur. 


## Installation
I'd recommend using Android Studio for running this application, as it is still in beta.


## State of development
This is in a working beta state, however it is missing many quality of life features, such as user-friendly UI.

### Future Steps 
* Add a more battery efficient option to run the background notification service, that utilizes Androids' wake periods (currently it keeps the device awake, which is bad for battery life).
* Enhance the UI, it has not been worked on at all and looks a bit clunky.
* Make deals clickable, both inside the app and from notifications.
* Add option to control how many posts are loaded (and ensure the scrapers are able to load more posts).
* Fix Android Studio Code warnings (its mostly minor stuff remaining).
* Add support for other countries.
